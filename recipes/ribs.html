            <li>Meanwhile make barbecue sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients in a large saucepan. Place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until smooth and to allow the flavours to develop.

            <li>Preheat oven to 160C/140C fan-forced. Line a large baking dish with baking paper. Combine 1 cup cold water with 2/3 cup barbecue sauce. Arrange ribs in a single layer in prepared dish. Pour over sauce mixture (see note). Cover with foil. Bake, turning once, for 2 hours 30 minutes or until tender. Using tongs, transfer ribs to a large baking tray. Brush with another 1/3 cup of sauce (see note).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine butter and parmesan in a bowl. Season well with pepper. Gently peel husks back from corn. Remove silk from corn. Rub half the butter mixture over corn. Gently pull back the husks. Twists ends to secure.
