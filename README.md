# The website that will be constructed, will be a summary of food recipes (which links will be provided). i will structure the webiste with all forms of "href", primarily using absolute links to other webpages.

# With the use of elemental tags to markup the text and importance of each word, i will focus on which is to be left as plain text or which will be emphazised.

# At the end of the mini-project, it will be inherent that my use of the git commands and following html protocols, are specially used appropriately and correctly.
